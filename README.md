# 🌐 FrontEnd - Buildini

This repository contains the frontend application for **Buildini**, a construction and project management platform designed to help project managers oversee operations, generate reports, and leverage AI-powered insights for better decision-making. The frontend is built using modern web development technologies to deliver an intuitive and responsive user experience.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Visualize project metrics with interactive charts
- 📑 View project details including budget, team, tasks, and risk levels
- ✍️ Create and sign reports digitally
- 📈 AI-powered insights: budget variance prediction and risk analysis
- ☁️ Cloud-based storage of signed and rated project reports
- 🧑‍💼 User-specific views for project managers and stakeholders

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

### Frontend Stack

- **HTML5 / CSS3** – Markup and styling
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – Core scripting
- **Chart Library** – For dynamic graphs (e.g., ApexCharts or Chart.js)
- **Material Design Principles** – Layout and components (potentially using Angular Material)
- **REST API Integration** – Communication with Buildini backend
- **Cloud Integration** – Stores finalized reports

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Optional: Local server for testing static files (e.g., VS Code Live Server or Python HTTP server)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevDevahmed/FrontEnd.git
   cd FrontEnd
   ```

2. **Run Locally**:
   - Open `index.html` or `dashboard.html` directly in your browser
   - Or, use a local server:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8080
     ```

3. **Access in Browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

## 🔌 Integration with Backend

This frontend connects to the [Buildini Backend](https://github.com/DevDevahmed/Buildini), which provides REST APIs for:

- User authentication
- Project data
- AI predictions (budget variance, risk assessment)

**Note:** Ensure the backend is running at `http://localhost:8080`, or update API URLs in the JS files accordingly. Enable CORS on the backend to allow frontend communication.

---

## 📡 API Interaction (Assumed Endpoints)

- `POST /auth/login` → Authenticate user and return JWT
- `GET /projects` → Retrieve all project summaries
- `GET /projects/{id}` → Fetch detailed data for a specific project
- `POST /reports` → Submit signed/rated project reports
- `GET /ai/predict-budget-variance` → Predict budget variance
- `GET /ai/risk-assessment` → Analyze risk levels

---

## 🛠️ Development Notes

- The project is written in **Vanilla JavaScript** (no framework yet).
- No build system or package manager is required.
- AI interaction and API calls are handled through plain `fetch()` requests.
- Always validate and sanitize user input before submission.

---

## 🚢 Deployment

To deploy on static hosting services (like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel):

1. Push the project to the `main` branch.
2. Configure the service to serve either `index.html` or `dashboard.html`.
3. Ensure API endpoints are accessible (use CORS or proxying if needed).
